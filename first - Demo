## Roadmap

- Clone both repos and run with npm start.

- Walk through: hash â†’ block â†’ blockchain (observe changes at each step).

- Explore the nonce (why it matters, trial and error).

- Cover the distributed aspect and tokens.

- Check keys & signatures (who did what).

- Wrap up by reviewing the full blockchain layout and its data.
