# For The Signers/Wallets Demo *seed phrase management

This demo shows the basics of managing Bitcoin wallets through seed phrases.
We walk through:

Creating a wallet and generating a seed phrase.

Backing up and restoring from the seed.

Removing a wallet and confirming funds are still recoverable.

The goal is to illustrate the three golden rules:

Bitcoin is money you hold yourself.

If you know your seed, you can always recover.

Even if a wallet is deleted, your Bitcoin is safe as long as you control the seed.
